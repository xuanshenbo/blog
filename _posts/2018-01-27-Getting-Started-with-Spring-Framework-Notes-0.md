Recently I wanted to start learning the Spring Framework systematically. After some research I found [Getting Started with Spring Framework](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1979962782/)
by [Ashish Sarin](https://www.amazon.com/Ashish-Sarin/e/B003R7CTLG/ref=dp_byline_cont_book_2) and [J Sharma](https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=dp_byline_sr_book_1?ie=UTF8&text=J+Sharma&search-alias=books&field-author=J+Sharma&sort=relevancerank)
could be a good book for beginners. Now I have read the first two chapters, and think it is a good book, especially for junior Java developers to learn Spring, because of its examples and detailed explanations.

Therefore I decided to keep reading the book, and started this series of posts for reading notes.

In this series, each post will be a set of notes for one chapter of the book.

Note that although I will try my best to make this series easy to read for everyone, it serves as my personal reading notes, and is not a tutorial. Therefore it may not be in detail at all, and assumes
some background knowledge. In the future, I may post an actual Spring tutorial.
